SCION Toolkit
=============

SCION Toolkit is a collection of UI components and utilities designed primarily for use in SCION libraries and their demo and test applications. The toolkit is published as single NPM library with a separate entry point per tool, allowing for tree shaking away not used tools. The library has a peer-dependency on the Angular framework, since some tools are Angular-specific.

The sources for this package are in [SCION Toolkit](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/scion-toolkit) repo. Please file issues and pull requests against that repo.
