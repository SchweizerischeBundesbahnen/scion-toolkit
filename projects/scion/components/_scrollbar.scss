/**
 * The package.json standard allows specifying conditional exports, not only for JavaScript files, but also for SASS files.
 * They are supported by the Angular compiler, but not yet by all IDEs. Therefore, we additionally provide this entry point.
 * See https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports for more information about conditional SASS exports.
