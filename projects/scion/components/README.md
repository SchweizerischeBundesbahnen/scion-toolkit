SCION Components | @scion/components
====================================

The SCION Components is a collection of Angular components and directives primarily for use in SCION libraries such as [`@scion/workbench`][link-scion-workbench] and [`@scion/microfrontend-platform`][link-scion-microfrontend-platform]. This library is not a comprehensive component library as its focus is on SCION requirements.
